    "\n",
    "    - âœ… **Hyperparameter Search**: Before full model training, it is recommended to perform a hyperparameter search. This involves multiple short training runs on different hyperparameter sets to approximate full training performance. The best-performing set is then selected. Expanding the search space or using better approximations can improve results but requires more time and compute resources. Make sure you have enough Lightning AI credits before doing so.  \n",

This can be done on the test split of the training dataset (this should usually be done after training the model) or on a completely new dataset to check generalization. To evaluate on the full dataset, enable the \"evaluate on full\" checkbox before running the evaluation cell, only do this if you did not train the model on the same data.  \n",
